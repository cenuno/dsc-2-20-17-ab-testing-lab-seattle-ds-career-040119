    "\n",
    "You've been tasked with designing an experiment to test whether a new email template will be more effective for your company's marketing team. The current template has a 5% response rate, which has outperformed numerous other templates in the past. As a result of some very poor performance from some of these alternative templates, the company is both excited to test this new design that was developed internally, and nervous about losing sales, if it is not to work out. As a result, they are looking to determine how many individuals they will need to serve the new email template to in order to detect a 1% performance increase (or drop).\n",

In this case, we will have a binomial variable (they either respond to the email or don't) and thus the variance, can be calculated with a standard formula: $n\\bullet p\\bullet(1-p)$ however, this also requires knowledge of p, the probability of response from the updated template. After conducting a limited sample however, we can extrapolate more and detemine if we have sufficient evidence or not.\n",
